    "Fresh water flows towards the coast, where it exits in the saltwater of the sea or ocean. The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater in the aquifer is approximated as an interface. The freshwater is slightly lighter than the saltwater so that it flows on top of the saltwater (see Figure). Solutions for steady interface flow concern an end situation with flowing freshwater and stagnant saltwater. The point where the interface intersects the bottom of the aquifer is called the toe of the interface while the point where the interface intersects the sea bottom is called the tip. For the solution presented here, the size of the outflow zone below the sea bottom is neglected so that the tip of the interface is at the shoreline (the Dupuit approximation). "
