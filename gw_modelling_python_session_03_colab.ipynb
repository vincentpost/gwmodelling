    "Pumping wells form an important part of groundwater models. The principle of superposition allows for the solution of problems with an arbitrary number of wells. The organization of solutions with multiple wells becomes cumbersome when the number of wells grows. The analytic element method is a modeling technique that facilitates the superposition of many solutions, including wells. \n",

    "The analytic element method is based on the superposition of analytic solutions. Each analytic solution represents a feature in the aquifer and has at least one free parameter. For example, the solution for a pumping well is an analytic element and the free parameter is the discharge of the well. The free parameter of an analytic element may either be specified or computed from specified conditions. For example, the discharge of a well may be computed from the head specified at the well (really, at the well radius). All unknown free parameters in a model are computed simultaneously as, e.g., the discharge of one well may effect the head at another well and vice versa. "

The model then computes the discharge of the well (or the discharges of multiple wells) such that the heads are equal to the specified heads.
